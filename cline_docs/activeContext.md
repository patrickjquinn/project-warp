# Active Context - Warp Code IDE

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on completing core canvas functionality, code synchronization features, and improving the settings system.

### Active Development Areas

1. **Canvas Functionality**
   - Implementing resize handles for components
   - Adding rotation controls
   - Improving nested component handling
   - Developing component alignment tools

2. **Code Synchronization**
   - Completing bi-directional sync between canvas and code
   - Implementing preservation of custom component logic
   - Adding error handling for invalid states

3. **Settings System**
   - ✅ Implemented settings panel with type-safe controls
   - ✅ Added theme, font, and layout settings
   - ✅ Added search functionality for settings
   - Need to add settings persistence across sessions
   - Need to implement settings migration system

## Known Issues

### Critical
1. **Canvas**
   - Resize handles not fully implemented
   - Component nesting needs improvement
   - Alignment system incomplete

2. **Code Sync**
   - Bi-directional sync not fully reliable
   - Custom component logic not preserved
   - Error handling needs improvement

3. **Settings**
   - Settings not persisted across sessions
   - No migration system for settings changes
   - No import/export functionality

### Non-Critical
1. **UI/UX**
   - Property panel organization needs improvement
   - Missing keyboard shortcuts
   - Limited component templates

2. **Documentation**
   - Missing inline documentation
   - Incomplete API documentation
   - User documentation needed
