# Project WarpCode Status Report

## Project Overview
WarpCode is a Tauri 2 + Svelte based application builder and IDE that provides:
- Full code tree visualization
- Project creation from GitHub templates
- Code editor with direct manipulation capabilities
- Visual canvas for drag-and-drop component building
- Real-time preview with bi-directional sync
- Property panel for component customization
- Glassmorphic UI design

## Current Implementation Status

### Core Architecture
- Built on Tauri 2.0 for native performance and security
- Svelte frontend for reactive UI components
- Configured for both desktop and potential mobile support
- Implements Tauri's new permissions system

### Completed Components

1. **Canvas Store System**
- Implemented state management for canvas items
- Added support for selection, copying, and positioning
- Created grid and snap functionality
- Implemented zoom controls

2. **Component Palette**
- Created draggable component system
- Implemented glassmorphic design
- Added basic widget templates (Container, Label, Button, etc.)

3. **Property Panel**
- Built style property editor
- Added common and widget-specific properties
- Implemented real-time style updates

4. **Code Mapping System**
- Created Svelte AST parser
- Implemented code generation from canvas state
- Added bi-directional sync between code and canvas
- Built type definitions for AST manipulation

### In Progress

1. **Canvas Functionality**
- Implementing resize handles
- Adding rotation controls
- Improving nested component handling
- Adding component alignment tools

2. **Code Synchronization**
- Completing bi-directional sync implementation
- Adding support for custom component logic preservation
- Implementing proper error handling for invalid states

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Canvas Enhancement**
- [ ] Add resize handles with proper constraints
- [ ] Implement rotation system
- [ ] Add alignment guides
- [ ] Improve drag-and-drop precision
- [ ] Add component nesting support
- [ ] Implement undo/redo system

2. **Code Integration**
- [ ] Complete code generation system
- [ ] Add support for custom component logic
- [ ] Implement proper error recovery
- [ ] Add code formatting options
- [ ] Implement code snippets system

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
- [ ] Enhance glassmorphic design
- [ ] Add more component templates
- [ ] Improve property panel organization
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Implement context menus

4. **Project Management**
- [ ] Add project templates system
- [ ] Implement GitHub integration
- [ ] Add project export options
- [ ] Implement project settings

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**
- Complete resize handles and rotation system
- Finish bi-directional sync system
- Implement component nesting

2. **Short Term**
- Add undo/redo functionality
- Implement alignment system
- Enhance code generation

3. **Medium Term**
- Add more templates
- Improve UI/UX
- Add project management features

4. **Long Term**
- Add collaborative features
- Implement plugin system
- Add advanced code analysis

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**
- Need to better organize store implementations
- Improve type definitions
- Add proper error boundaries

2. **Testing**
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Implement integration tests
- Add end-to-end testing

3. **Documentation**
- Add inline documentation
- Create API documentation
- Add user documentation

## Conclusion
The project has a solid foundation with Tauri 2 and Svelte, providing excellent performance and cross-platform capabilities. The focus is now on enhancing the canvas manipulation capabilities and improving the code synchronization system to handle more complex scenarios while preserving custom logic. The glassmorphic UI provides a modern and attractive interface that needs to be consistently applied across all new features.
