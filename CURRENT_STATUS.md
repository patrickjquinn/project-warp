# Project Status Report

## Current Task
Migrating the project to Tauri 2.0 and fixing various UI/functionality issues.

## Completed Work
1. Updated Tauri dependencies to version 2.0
2. Fixed routing system to work with Tauri 2.0
3. Implemented new dialog plugin functionality
4. Updated window management system
5. Fixed project path handling in URLs
6. Restored basic navigation between launcher and editor windows

## Current Issues
1. Terminal functionality not working properly
2. UI panes in editor window are blank
3. File explorer not displaying project structure
4. Project path not being correctly passed to components

## Required Fixes
1. Terminal Component:
   - Review Terminal.svelte implementation
   - Check terminal session creation in backend
   - Verify terminal event handling

2. UI Layout:
   - Debug HSplitPane and VSplitPane components
   - Verify CSS styles are being applied correctly
   - Check component mounting lifecycle

3. File Explorer:
   - Debug project structure loading
   - Verify file system event handling
   - Fix path handling between frontend and backend

4. Project Path Handling:
   - Review URL parameter parsing
   - Check path encoding/decoding
   - Verify path propagation to child components

## Project Structure
- Frontend (Svelte):
  - Views: Launcher.svelte, AppBuilder.svelte
  - Components: Explorer, Terminal, Editor, Canvas components
  - Stores: activeFile, directoryStore
  - Routing: svelte-spa-router

- Backend (Tauri):
  - Window Management
  - File System Operations
  - Terminal Management
  - Project Structure Handling

## Dependencies
- Tauri 2.0
- Svelte
- svelte-spa-router
- svelte-split-pane
- Various Tauri plugins (dialog, shell, fs, process)

## Next Steps
1. Debug terminal functionality:
   - Review terminal session creation
   - Check event handling
   - Verify shell command execution

2. Fix UI rendering:
   - Debug component mounting
   - Check style application
   - Verify layout calculations

3. Fix file explorer:
   - Debug project structure loading
   - Fix path handling
   - Verify file system events

4. Improve error handling:
   - Add better error messages
   - Implement error recovery
   - Add user feedback

## Long-term Improvements
1. Improve accessibility (current A11y warnings)
2. Better error handling and user feedback
3. Optimize performance
4. Add tests
5. Improve documentation

## Notes
- The project uses a complex architecture with multiple components and services
- Tauri 2.0 migration introduced several breaking changes
- Need to carefully handle file paths across platform differences
- Terminal functionality needs special attention for cross-platform compatibility
